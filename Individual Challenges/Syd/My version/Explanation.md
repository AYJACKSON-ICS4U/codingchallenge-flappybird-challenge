## I have made my own version by: 
* I changed the bird image
* I played with the colours and variables, for instance the gravity
* I found a way to increase the speed of the pipes so that they speed up as they approach the bird to make it more of a challenge for the players. I did this by creating a counter and every time this counter does a modular division of ten and gives an answer of zero, the speed increases
