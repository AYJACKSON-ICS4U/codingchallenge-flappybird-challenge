## January 9th
Today I have:
* created four files, one index in html and three others (bird, pipe, and sketch) in JavaScript to be able to code along with Dan Shiffman in his video
* I have successfully created a canvas with an ellipse bird. I am also able to apply a gravity force to it and lift it up when I press the spacebar.

## January 10th
Today I have:
* modified the image of the bird. What used to simply be an ellipse is now a bird with an eye and a beak
* I have watched the entire coding challenge video
* I have finished coding with Dan Shiffman, meaning that my game is now at the same point his is 

## January 15th
Today I have:
* played with the different variables, for example gravity and the lift force, to find my preferred values for my game
