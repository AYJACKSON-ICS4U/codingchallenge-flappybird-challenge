## January 9th
Today I created four files, one index in html and three others (bird, pipe, and sketch) in JavaScript to be able to code along with Dan Shiffman in his video. I have successfully created a canvas with an ellipse bird. I am also able to apply a gravity force to it and lift it up when I press the spacebar.
