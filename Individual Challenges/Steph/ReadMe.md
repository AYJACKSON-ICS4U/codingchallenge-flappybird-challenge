# Steps(Jan 8th 2018)
- I opened HTML on brackets and on chrome then linked up my sketch.js
- I made sure I knew how to create a canvas on brackets
- Next I learned how to overlap different js files before I even started looking at Dan's code (It's good to familiarize yourself with your tools before starting)
- I started following alng with his video and am currently at 4:50 seconds
- So far my bird shows on a blank canvas and gravity can pull it down and stop it at the bottom of the screen
